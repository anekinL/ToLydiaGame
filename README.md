# ToLydiaGame

This game is a short story game that was developed on the Godot 4 engine using **C++, GDScript, Aseprite** and some online assets. 

The game GUI, Start/Menu screen as well as a Large majority of the games graphics/animations were created by me using Aseprite (an graphical creation application targeted at pixel art/animations) and Adobe Photoshop. 

For the start menu screen I created a small panel using aseprite and duplicated the panel into a paralax effect, along with a diagonal sliding animation to make it look dynamic and satifying. 

As per the sound design of the game I used some online free mp3's and created some of my own specific ones just using garage band. 

In terms of the backend developemnt process, it was very simple and linear, using global variables to keep track of the choices you made as well as a counter. Mostly used arrays as the main data structure for the game data management. 

Additionally, I used some godot4 extensions created by the community specifically an extension called "Dialogic" to help with some dialogue animations and logic in some sections of the game.

This was one of my first fully developed original games that I enjoyed creating.
